## Question: Sudesh Sharma is a Linux expert who wants to have an online system where he can handle student queries. Since there can be multiple requests at any time he wishes to dedicate a fixed amount of time to every request so that everyone gets a fair share of his time. He will log into the system from 10am to 12am only. He wants to have separate requests queues for students and faculty. Implement a strategy for the same. The summary at the end of the session should include the total time he spent on handling queries and average query time.

We have to implement the above problem in any programing lang possible and the method I chose to solve it was Round Robin scheduling. To read more about [Round Robin](https://www.javatpoint.com/os-round-robin-scheduling-algorithm) check the hyperlink.
